# Meet Yuni!

Yuni is my very own AI Assistant built using the ChatGPT API. She functions just like a regular assistant, answering questions and listening to commands just like any other LLM!

## Key Features

- **Persistent Memory:** On first boot, Yuni creates a TXT file to store all the messages exchanged. This means she remembers past conversations even after the program is closed.
- **Convenient Position:** Yuni is always on the bottom-right of your screen and occasionally blinks (=^=).
- **Voice Interaction:** To interact with her, simply press the Enter key. She will calibrate the microphone (@^@) and start listening to you (O^O)?.
- **Emotions:** Depending on the answer, Yuni will make a new Unicode based face, like (T_T) or -\_('-'_/-.
